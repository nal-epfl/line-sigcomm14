# Documentation for the config file for line-traffic, with examples below.
#
# You can use line-traffic after you have configured the network on all the machines which will be used to exchange
# traffic.
#
# This file is used to configure how the machines will open TCP/UDP sockets and send traffic.
# Each line is of the form:
#
#   connection ip1 ip2 param1 [param]...
#
# Generally, traffic will flow from a client socket bound to ip1 to a server socket bound to ip2. A socket to be bound
# to an IP address is opened on a machine iff there is a network interface on that machine with an IP addess matching
# the socket's IP address. This means that you can use the same config file on all the machines, and line-traffic will
# figure out automatically on which machine it needs to open each socket.
#
# Connection types:
#
#   TCP [on-off onDurationMin onDurationMax offDurationMin ofDurationMax] [class diffServ] [cc congestionControlAlg] [x multiplier]
#
#     TCP transfer, by default continuous (i.e. infinite), unless the on-off parameter is present.
#
#     Parameters:
#
#       on-off onDurationMin onDurationMax offDurationMin ofDurationMax
#
#         Keep the connection open for a random number of seconds between [onDurationMin, onDurationMax], then close the
#         connection and keep it closed for a random number of seconds between [offDurationMin, offDurationMax], then
#         repeat.
#         The durations are generated randomly once, by sampling from a uniform distribution, and then are reused.
#         The parameters are read as floating point numbers, the unit is seconds.
#
#       class diffServ
#
#         Set the diffServ field in the IP header to the given value (read as a decimal number). By default, set to 0.
#
#       cc congestionControlAlg
#
#         Set the TCP congestion control algorithm for the socket to the given value.
#         Valid values are the ones in: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_available_congestion_control. You might have to modprobe
#         the modules implementing other congestion control agorithms.
#         By default, uses the system's default, i.e. the value in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_congestion_control.
#
#       x multiplier
#
#         Create multiple parallel connections with identical parameters.
#         The multiplier is read as a positive integer decimal.
#         By default, set to 1.
#
#
#   TCP-Poisson-Pareto poissonRate paretoAlpha paretoScale [sequential]
#
#     Defines a TCP connection with a pause time between transfers, and the size of the transfers sampled from a Pareto
#     distribution.
#
#     Parameters:
#
#       poissonRate
#
#         The rate of creating new connections per second, given as a positive floating point number.
#         If the parameter "sequential" is present, only one connection can be open at a time. As long as the current
#         transfer has not finished, no new connections are created. After a transfer finishes, it is followed by a
#         pause time with the duration sampled from the exponential distribution corresponding to a Poisson process with
#         average rate poissonRate. After the pause time, a new transfer is started.
#         If the parameter "sequential" is not present, parallel connections are possible. New transfers are started by
#         a Poisson process with average rate poissonRate.
#
#       paretoAlpha
#
#         The alpha parameter of the Pareto distribution of the transfer size. Positive floating point number.
#         If you use 2.0, then the distribution will have a mean equal to paretoScale.
#
#       paretoScale
#
#         The scale parameter of the Pareto distribution of the transfer size.
#         Given as a string with the format:
#
#           integer[multiplier]unit
#
#         where:
#
#           integer is a number given as decimal;
#
#           multiplier is a SI prefix, one of: kmgtpezyKMGTPEZY;
#
#           unit is either b for bits or B for Bytes.
#
#       sequential
#
#         Whtether to create parallel or sequential transfers. See the explanation for poissonRate above.
#
#
#   TCP-DASH rate_Mbps bufferingRate_Mbps bufferingTime_s streamingPeriod_s
#
#     Defines a TCP DASH transfer.
#
#     Parameters:
#
#       rate_Mbps
#
#         Average data rate, floating point number in Mbps.
#
#       bufferingRate_Mbps
#
#         Buffering rate, floating point number in Mbps.
#
#       bufferingTime_s
#
#         Buffering time, floating point number in seconds. The transfer is throttled for bufferingTime_s seconds.
#
#       streamingPeriod_s
#
#         The period during which chunks are sent chunks without source-throttling during the streaming phase.
#
#
#   UDP-CBR rate_Mbps [poisson] [on-off onDurationMin onDurationMax offDurationMin ofDurationMax]
#
#     Defines a constant (by default) or average bitrate UDP transfer.
#
#     Parameters:
#
#       rate_Mbps
#
#         The data rate, floating point number in Mbps.
#
#       poisson
#
#         If not present, this is a constant bitrate transfer.
#         If present, this is an average bitrate transfer, with chunks sent according to a Poisson process with the given
#         rate.
#
#       on-off onDurationMin onDurationMax offDurationMin ofDurationMax
#
#         See the description for TCP connections.
#
#
# How to run line-traffic:
#
#   1. Start line-traffic on every machine which will generate traffic:
#
#      line-traffic --text-config configFileName
#
#   2. Sleep for a couple of seconds to give it time to open the server sockets.
#
#   3. Send the signal SIGUSR1 to every instance of line-traffic (this will start the transfers):
#
#      killall -SIGUSR1 line-traffic
#
